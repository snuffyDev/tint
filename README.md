Another JavaScript/TypeScript utility library??

<br/>

Tint (<i>Thanks, I Needed That!</i>) is a utility library that aims to be simple, easy to use, and out of the way. It mainly exists as a way for me to have the things I normally use be "all under one roof". It doesn't intend to be the end-all-be-all of libraries, but it does its job well.

Performance is something that is also a main goal for this library, since a sluggish library can make or break both user and developer experience.
